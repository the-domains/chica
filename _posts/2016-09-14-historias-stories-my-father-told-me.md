## Historias... Stories my father told me

_by Yareliz Mendez-Zamora_

"Once upon a time, there was a man who had a relationship with God like none other. The man prayed, fasted, served in church and worked in the soup kitchen on his days off. He was _that _type of man, the type that dripped sanctity from his pores. God would only have to whisper -a murmur lost in the wind- but the man could hear His voice clearly.

Vaya, el tipo had one ear in Heaven and the other on Earth, God spoke and the man not only listened, but obeyed. Because the man obeyed, life was good. The man had not known poverty, had not known the type of hunger that claws at your stomach and makes you so ill that you can't see straight. Had not known the name of the feeling that makes sweat pool underneath your arm. The man had only known the warmth of God's love and mercy.

One day, God tells the man that He will take him to the richest place on Earth. Immediately, the man starts to get ready. Puts on the nicest suit he has in his closet, shines his shoes, whitens his teeth, and drenches himself in the most expensive perfume he owns.

'So God, where am I headed?' The man asks.

God sends him the address in that mysterious way He likes to work, and the man is a little bit miffed. But that baina is right there! The richest place on Earth was in his neighborhood.

'Alright then,' the man thought. 'I get to save a bit on gas.'

So the man gets into his car and takes off. Turns left, right, goes straight. Turns left, right, left again. You get the point.

Suddenly, the man finds himself in front of a cemetery and tries to ignore the smell of flowers, dirt, and the fact that this is the location that his body will rot.

'Pero Dios,' he says, 'I'm in front of a cemetery. Are You sure that this is the richest place on Earth?'

'Of course, chico,' God says. 'Where else would it be?'

My father looked at me and said: You, my daughter, were not born to die without leaving a legacy.
