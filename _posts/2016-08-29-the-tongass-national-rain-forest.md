# The Tongass National Rain Forest

_"What are they thinking, the tress on the hills? They could be the souls of these who fell on their way to heaven or those who lived this place too much and decided to root in the rocks instead of ascending in light. They are transformed in snow; they could be an order of angels seen by Oertha, guard of the North. They carry layers of light and dark in their arms; they could be records of time played over by needles of wind and ice, or messenger waiting for orders to run down the slopes with their sharp, green words. What are they doing, the tress on the hills-remembering frogs and springtime of fern? Before we grow old we must go to them there on the slopes and ask them how it will be when we clim into other shapes- and if theirs is a good one to take, holding green to the hills" _Sheila Nickelson

## Saving American's Last Rain Forest: The Tongass National Forest

Through conservation, we can manage our resources so that our future generations have the gift of living in this world and all its beauty. Conservation of our national resources has gone through many struggles, in trying to lace these concepts into credible scientific theories and facts. Despite the evidence we have, policy makers have constantly toyed with the environment, particularly in preserving our natural resources, such as our National Forest.

America's only temperate rainforest, and largest forest of the Unites States, the Tongass National Forest has been a battleground between pro-loggia politicians and conservationists. Dues to its particular diversity, sustaining some of the most abundant old-growth timber in the world, "By the late 1980s, as may as 28,000 acres were being clear-cut each year". The governments as well as pro-logging politicians argue that the timber industry offers economic value to this southeast region of Alaska. But logging what little old growth remains could result in a catastrophic impact in this area of Alaska both for the environment and the economy. But how can we safeguard the future of the Tongass National Forest and the surrounding, areas, while still ensuring economic stability in this region? In order to protect the future of the Tongass the u=must understand that managing the Tongass today will maintain the sustainability of the region tomorrow, as well as of the next human life cycle. But what makes this rainforest so unique? What is the importance of conserving the Tongass?

Being one of the last intact ancient rainforest, "The Tongass embraces spectacular mountain, enormous glacier, silent valley, about a thousand islands, and intricate lacework of streams and rives" which are essential in the Subsistence of the " way life" for the indigenous people of the Tongass. Subsistence, as defined in the American Heritage College Dictionary, is a " means of subsisting, especially one barely sufficient to maintain life." And through all it's natural history which it holds, the Tongass is on elf the last places in the United States where _every plant and animal species know to have existed before Columbus is still here._

The Tongass is a host of rare and endangered species, which rely on the intact nature of the forest. The Sitka black tailed deer is one of which is not only known for its' beauty, but also as a source of food to the indigenous Sitka. The particular grizzly that lives in the Tongass is another creature which heavily relies on the sustainability of the forest and its trees. Recent revelations from geneticist unveiled that grizzly bears that live in Sitka (city which rest inside the Tongass), are particularly different other's that inhabit the world. Since they have been isolated in this removed wonderland, their evolutionary process has been tremendously slower that the rest of the worlds bears.

While visiting the wonder for eh Sitka spruce and hemlocks that canopy southeastern Alaska's dense forest, John Muir described what he saw as "still in the morning of creation". John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club in 1914, and considered to be the forefathers' of environmentalism, had an early vision of not only what beauty nature holds, but also the importance of what nature has for people, animals and everything sustained on Earth, thus introducing the world to the concept of conservation. Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is a term that refers to a renewable source from "the different forms of life and life-sustaining processes". "The countless streams in the Tongass continues to throb with salmon, whose dying bodies fertilize the soil; locals call the tallest tress 'salmon tress' for this reason. In turn, the old-growth canopy keeps snow off the ground and sunlight off the streams, allowing deer to forage and fish to thrive in cool waters. Deer feed the wolves, fish feed the bears, and both feed the people". This is the biodiversity of the Southeast Alaska, and this is why it is important to sustain the environment, using it responsibly. Rainforest are also considered a type of blueprint for making most of the world's prescription drugs, mapping the history of this land.

In 1897, Alaska was sold by the Russians' to Secretary of State William Seward for $7 million, at which time the indigenous people of this region had full right to their land. But this seemed to be of no importance when the Alaska Statehood Act of 1958 gave the governor control of one-third of the 365 million acres in Alaska for its economic base. The indigenous people's rights seems to dissipate, and now the Native Alaskans of the area, the Tlingit people of Kwan. This eventually resulted in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, "Which granted 44 million acres and nearly $1 billion to 12 newly created Native corporations-for-profit corporations whose capitalist mission some native individuals have found contradictory to their cultural values".

The Tlingit's and Haida are the tow types of indigenous people that occupy the Southeast region of Alaska. The Tlingit's have been hit the hardest by the depletion of the land their culture has sustained itself on for centuries. Left to fend for themselves, as their precious land has been raped, leaving them to wander, and hoping that the next spot they reside in will remain intact. Without the natural resources which maintain the welfare of these indigenous people, we have pillaged what is left of the Tlingit's.

This is only the beginning of this history that has shaped Alaska's environment. In 1963, The Sierra Club urged the creation of national parks, at which time Tongas national Forest was created. In 1969, the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC) was established, aimed at protecting 80 million acres in Alaska. After years of negotiating in Congress, President Jimmy Carter settled the matter by signing the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) on December 2, 1980\. Groundbreaking in conservation, ANILCA established ten new national parks and expanded three more, doubling the size of the entire US National Park System and tripling the amount of federally designated wilderness. But everything has a cost; the bill also issued oil exploration along the giant harvests in the virgin forests of the Southeast, while settling few limits on its use a potential hazards.

October 16, 1999, was the date in which the Forest Service made their first move in a historic effort to permanently protect the remaining wildlife. The Tongass was unprotected at the time, and has been at the center of conservation efforts which continue to this day.
