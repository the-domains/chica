# My hair

Valeria Diaz de Leon

As she began to maneuver her hands through my hair, she felt the thickness of what flows out of my head. She shouted, "Oh my gosh, your hair is so thick. We're going to need more bobby pins". Embarrassed, I glanced towards my friends' long, thin, blonde hair, and I stared at myself in the mirror. I am different. Like many Latinas, I went through many struggles of acceptance, of accepting the fact that there is no ideal beauty and that everyone should love and embrace their uniqueness. I was not alone in this journey and I found comfort in Latino literature with authors like Raquel Cepedos, Michelle Serros, and Piri Thomas, they too begin to notice their differences and begin to accept themselves.

Hair has always been a distinct characteristic that I am different. My best friend in elementary school, who is white, had the most beautiful long, blonde, thin, straight hair. On the other hand, my hair was black, thick, wavy, and on bad days, curly. I hated when my mother would pull my hair, as if she was ripping my brain out, to twist the hair tie around once more before it ruptured and let loose the waves of my Mexican hair. To this day it's always been a struggle of not knowing how far I can push my hair tie to the limit before it escapes my fingertips and flings across the room in pain. I have broken hair brushes and hair ties and bobby pins are always found in my hair as I shower even after I swore I removed them all.

Every time I get my hair done or cut, I am reminded of my strong Mexican hair. I will always remember my best friend's eighth birthday at Club Libby Lu, the hot spot for cool girls' birthday parties. We were all excited because we would be getting our pelo done. As mentioned before, the woman doing my hair was stunned at how massive and curly my hair was. She humiliated me in front of my friends and made me realize how that physical characteristic, my hair, set me apart from the rest of the blondes in the party group.

Michelle Serros, author of How to be a Chicana Role Model, explains the difficulty of accepting these physical attributes. During her senior picture day, Serros discusses her sacred ritual of squeezing her nose. She writes "my nose has actually become smaller, narrower. It looks like Indian" (14). She even begins to give her nose an ethnicity, as if it were not a part of her.

She compares her new nose to that of her best friend Terri's. She imagines how her nose will "look just like Terri's and then I'll have the best picture in the yearbook" (14). She begins to compare her nose to that of Terri's as I did with my hair. I compared the texture, length, thickness, and color to that of my best friend. I longed for the simplicity of their hair and wanted to rid myself of the complex strands that fell upon my shoulders.

I understood that I did not belong in their imagined community but in a different one. One where others look, talk, eat, like me. I was excluded from their world because not once did they experience what I went through from that day on. I yearned to belong to their community.

My heart ached when my mother did not buy me a hair straightener. I did the craziest things possible to make my hair as straight as it could be, like lying it straight down as I went to bed, reminding myself to not move an inch as I slept because it could produce a wave in the morning.

I had one of my best friends use a plancha to straighten my hair before her mom got home. It was the closest thing she had to a straightener. I went to ludicrous measures so that my hair and I could become a citizen of their blonde, thin, straight world.

Throughout middle school I began to surround myself with people who looked like me because the school was becoming more diverse. My best friend in middle school had the most beautiful, curly, goddess-like hair. I adored her hair and yet I had this hostile resentment towards mine. Piri Thomas, author of Down These Mean Streets, knew exactly how that resentment feels and how it lingers inside of your biggest insecurity. Thomas explains that "it wasn't right to be ashamed of what one was. It was like hating Momma for the color she was and Poppa for the color he wasn't" (121). Thomas also knew his hair set him apart from the rest. Thomas describes his hair as "thick, black, and wiry." And he "mentally compared my hair with my brothers' hair.

My face screwed up at the memory of the jillion tons of stickum hair oils splashed down in a vain attempt to make it like their" (121). Like Thomas, I also used millions of hair products to make my hair like "theirs". I used serums to tame the frizz of my unruly hair, heat to make it as straight as possible, and dyed it to disguise the deep black tone.

Another Latina author writes about el pelo idealizado. Raquel Cepeda's Birds of Paradise: How I became a Latina describes her step mother Alice's hair upon meeting her. Cepeda explains that "Alice's razor-thin blond hair is what people in Santo Domingo call Bueno, but I don't understand how that kind of hair can be good. It doesn't move at all, or ripple like the water in Boca Chica when I throw shells at it" (43). She realizes that other Latinos idolize this kind of hair and consider it the good type to have. One that listens to your commands, that won't frizz or curl when it rains outside, and that does not need a million bobby pins to keep your Mexican hair in place.

It was the good kind of hair to have because it obeyed your word. Not only did my best friends have this good hair, but so did my sister. Every day it stared me in the face as we went to sleep, woke up, and got ready for school. She had long, thin, brown hair. To me, brown was way better than black. In all actuality, any color was better than black. Her thin Mexican hair set her apart. She did not look as Mexican as I did, for her lighter skin complexion helped her as well.

She always laughed at the amount of time I spent in the bathroom fighting my hair, as I lost the battles every morning. Never did she struggle as much as I did. Sometimes she would time me; it would be an hour, an hour and a half that I would spend on just my hair. She knows about my battles on the exterior, but not on the interior. She will never know what it is like to have my Mexican hair.

My Mexican identity is strongly connected to my hair. As I grew up I saw commercialized beauty and how my hair and I did not fit that category. My friends graced with blonde hair and I had the blackest hair. It was unbearable in the summer. The sun beating on my hair as a constant reminder that I am Mexican. The thickness gave me headaches. Not to mention the millions of hair ties that were killed during the batalla of putting it in a bun or even a pony tail. It was not until recent that I began to accept my hair and my identity. I began to miss my curls, the way they caressed my face and loved me. I damaged them with chemicals because I did not love them back.

Thomas also takes that journey of acceptance with his identity. He explains that he is "trying to be a Negro, a colored man, a black man 'cause that's what I am. But I gotta accept it myself, from inside" (124). Not only did I have to accept my hair and its differences, I had to accept my Mexican identity as well, from the inside, from mi alma. If I was not going to accept myself, then who was? I longed for that razor thin, blonde hair but I also missed the curls and the blackness of my old hair. Like many other Latinas, we are excluded from the media and told over and over that we are not beautiful and different, in reality we are. I am my hair. My unruly, untamable, curly, black hair allowed me to embrace, love, and accept my culture. It allowed me to accept myself.

Like Serros, Thomas, and Cepeda, it began with a journey of acceptance of my identity which was marked by my hair. I continue onto this journey of loving my hair. I am no longer obsessed with smoke that came up from the straightener as it slid across each strand. Good hair days consist of curls that come back from my childhood to say hello. I want the curls to stay and never have to say goodbye.

This journey will never be an easy one but it first begins with acceptance, acceptance ofthe marker that makes me Mexican, which is my hair. I am my hair. As with the authorspreviously mentioned, I embarked on this journey as did they. The journey of learning about myculture and connecting it with my hair. It becomes a part of my identity and my hair will always remind me of how amazing it is to be proud, not ashamed, of your culture.
