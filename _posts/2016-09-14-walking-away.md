# Walking Away

_by Prisca Dorcas Mojica Rodriguez_

---

The day after I graduated with mi maestría de Vanderbilt University, I packed my bags y regresé a la casa de mi mamá. The day in which I became what Amerikkka refers to as a 'respectable' immigrant, I left that world behind for the comfort of my mami's arms and homemade Nicaraguan food. The day that was supposed to start the rest of my life, I said: I need a break.

Academia is hard. Not just in the "_wow, I am going to need to go to the writing center often_" hard, or in the "_I am going to make new friends and that sucks_" hard, but more along the lines of "_Higher Ed is not made for someone from my neighborhood to thrive_" hard," or along the lines of "_I am the first in my family to do this so I had to Google what other people go through while in college_" hard, or even "_how do I show them know that I know I am not made for this place, but this place should still make a place for me_" hard.

I know that politics of respectability has been telling people from my communities that we have to get out of the barrios, but I also know that "trading-up" for racist, classist, sexist institutions designed to whitewash our stories and disenfranchise us, is one of the hardest things that many of us new immigrants and first generation college graduate students of color will go through.

So when I graduated, I decided to leave. I decided to leave to take care of myself. I decided that I needed my mami tohold me up for a bit, because I could no longer hold myself up. La lucha means that we will often have to rely on those around us, the soldados in our lives, to fight for us. Because when you stop feeling human, when you begin to forget that you're loved and that you're loving, you come running back to the person who will always love you, for me that was mi mami.

My resistance, on May 9, 2015, was in my leaving. We emphasize staying, fighting, persevering -- but that is often violent for our communities. So when we decide to leave, when we decide to take care of ourselves above anyone or anything else, we have to applaud it. Walking away from a harmful situation, Higher Education is my resistance.

About Prisca:

_Prisca Dorcas Mojica Rodriguez is a chonga Mujerista from Managua, Nicaragua currently living in Miami, FL. She recently graduated with her Masters from Vanderbilt University, and is looking to take some much needed time off to refresh. She is also the founder of Latina Rebels. Her interests are within biopolitics as it relates to Latina embodiment, specifically concerning models of conquerable flesh which dictate that the naturalization of womyn's bodies directly impacts entire countries and peoples. Thus her work is around reclaiming and upholding embodied resistance, particularly within chonga and chola subcultures. Que viva la mujer!_
